DOOR AUTOMATION 

Door automation involves to the use of PLC technology to automate the opening, closing, and securing of doors. This technology is widely used in residential, commercial, and industrial settings to enhance convenience, security, and energy efficiency. Automated doors are powered by systems that integrate mechanical, electrical, and electronic components to operate without manual intervention. 

COMPONENTS: 

Contains 2 different contactors that control electric motor for opening and closing the door. 

Contains OPEN switch, CLOSE switch and STOP switch. 

Contains up and down limit switches. 

Contains OPEN, CLOSE (SHUT), and AJAR indicator lights. 

2 NC switches can be introduced between OPEN and UP MOTOR and also between CLOSE and DOWN motor in order to prevent short circuiting the motor switching contactors if they are switched to run the same time (see Door automation motor short circuit problem PNG file).
